# Repository Guidelines

## Repository Purpose

This repository is the Claude Code-only marketplace for
`student-presentation-suite`. The publishable source of truth is the
`claude-code` branch of `YFan945/student-presentation-suite`.

Never publish this marketplace from or to `main`. The `main` branch is a
separate Codex implementation line with different manifests and runtime
dependencies.

## Repository Layout

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: marketplace manifest and published plugin version.
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml`: Windows/Linux tests and strict Claude validation.
- `plugins/student-presentation-suite/`: complete installable Claude Code plugin.
- `scripts/install_claude_plugin.ps1`: install, migrate, update, and dependency setup.
- `scripts/check_marketplace_release.py`: repository-level release validation.
- `README.md` / `README-zh.md`: marketplace installation and contributor documentation.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: newest-first version release history.

Inside the plugin package:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: plugin manifest.
- `skills/`: the three user-facing skill entrypoints and task-specific references.
- `references/`: shared intake, standards, image policy, and Slide Spec contracts.
- `scripts/`: environment checks, schema bridge, validation, and PPTX smoke tooling.
- `shared/`: reusable Python implementation.
- `tests/`: behavioral, schema, runtime, and delivery contracts.
- `examples/`: routing and interaction examples.

## Architecture And Ownership

The suite has three skills with non-overlapping outcomes:

- `student-presentation`: outline and speaking-plan work; never creates PPTX files.
- `student-presentation-review`: read-only diagnosis by default.
- `student-presentation-ppt`: editable PPTX creation and existing-deck improvement.

Canonical ownership:

- `references/presentation-intake.md`: clarification gate and workflow states.
- `references/shared-standards.md`: routing and presentation quality standards.
- `references/slide-spec.md` plus schema: structured planning and review-to-edit handoff.
- `references/image-strategy.md`: image sourcing and visual policy.
- PPTX skill references: production mechanics and visual style controls.

Keep each `SKILL.md` compact. Entry files should define trigger, responsibility,
state transition, core workflow, and output contract. Put detailed rules in
selectively loaded references and prevent duplicated policy from drifting.

## Required Behavior

PPTX creation and editing use this state sequence:

`intake_pending → intake_confirmed → planned → producing → qa → complete`

While `intake_pending`, the skill may inspect supplied files and gather
requirements, but must not run generation, rendering, environment, or delivery
commands. The user must approve a complete Production Summary before production.

Review-only requests must not modify the source artifact. Existing-deck edits
must preserve the original and use the structured fields `source_deck`,
`edit_intent`, `review_findings`, `preserve`, and `change_summary_required`.

User deliverables belong in `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/outputs` or the active
project's `outputs/` fallback. Never write generated decks into the installed
plugin or marketplace repository.

## Claude-Only Boundary

Do not add:

- `.codex-plugin`
- `agents/openai.yaml`
- `artifact-tool`
- Codex presentation runtime dependencies
- generated `.pptx`, `.png`, cache, or `node_modules` files

PPTX production depends on `document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills`.

## Editing Rules

- Update both English and Chinese README files when behavior, installation,
  architecture, requirements, or release procedures change.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for every release-worthy change.
- Keep `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`,
  `plugins/student-presentation-suite/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` on the same release version.
- Update schema, bridge, documentation, examples, and tests together when
  changing Slide Spec fields or workflow contracts.
- Never overwrite unrelated user changes in a dirty worktree.

## Validation

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r plugins/student-presentation-suite/requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r plugins/student-presentation-suite/requirements-claude-pptx.txt
npm --prefix plugins/student-presentation-suite ci
$env:PYTHONPATH=(Resolve-Path "plugins/student-presentation-suite").Path
python -m unittest discover -s plugins/student-presentation-suite/tests
python plugins/student-presentation-suite/scripts/smoke_pptx.py
python plugins/student-presentation-suite/scripts/check_plugin_release.py --json
python scripts/check_marketplace_release.py --json
python plugins/student-presentation-suite/scripts/check_claude_pptx_env.py --json --strict
claude plugin validate --strict .\plugins\student-presentation-suite
claude plugin validate --strict .
git diff --check
```

All checks must pass before publishing. If an environment dependency is absent,
report the exact missing tool rather than weakening a strict check.

## Release Procedure

1. Confirm the current branch is `claude-code`.
2. Review the complete worktree diff and exclude unrelated files.
3. Update documentation, `CHANGELOG.md`, and all synchronized version fields.
4. Run the full validation suite.
5. Commit the release changes and push a temporary branch.
6. Open a pull request targeting `claude-code`; the branch is protected and
   requires all status checks.
7. Merge only after the required checks pass.
8. Verify the remote `claude-code` SHA and release tag.

Do not merge or push these Claude Code plugin changes to `main`.
