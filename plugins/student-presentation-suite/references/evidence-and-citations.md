# Evidence And Citation Contract

## Evidence Ledger

Every factual chart, statistic, quotation, experiment result, survey finding, or
case claim should map to an `evidence_ledger` entry.

Each entry records:

- stable `id`;
- title or short description;
- source type;
- file path, URL, DOI, or bibliographic locator;
- author/organization and date when known;
- confidence: `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `unverified`;
- slides that use it;
- an optional limitation.

Never invent missing numbers, citations, user feedback, experiments, or survey
results. If evidence is unavailable, mark the claim as a proposal, assumption,
illustrative example, or evidence gap.

## Gap Detection

Flag:

- numbers without an evidence reference;
- causal language supported only by correlation or anecdote;
- experiment results without baseline, sample, metric, or comparison;
- user feedback without participant count or collection method;
- current facts without date/scope;
- quotations without author or source;
- citations listed but not used on any slide.

## Citation Styles

- `classroom`: short source line on slide, full details in references.
- `GB-T-7714`: unified Chinese academic reference list.
- `APA`: author-date in content and APA reference list.
- `none`: allowed only when the presentation contains no external factual claims
  or the user explicitly accepts an unreferenced informal showcase.

Keep one style across the deck. Put full URLs and long bibliographic details in
speaker notes or references rather than shrinking normal slide text.
