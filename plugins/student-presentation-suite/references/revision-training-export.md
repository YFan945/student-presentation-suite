# Revision, Training, And Export Contract

## Local Revision Operations

Supported edit intents:

- `rewrite-slide`
- `rewrite-section`
- `change-style`
- `compress`
- `expand`
- `add-evidence`

Apply only the requested scope. A slide with `locked: true` must not change
unless the user explicitly unlocks it. Use `create_revision_manifest.py` to
compare old and new specs and fail when a locked slide changed.

Revision manifests record parent revision, current revision, changed slides,
preserved locked slides, violations, reason, and file hashes. Store versioned
deliverables under `outputs/versions/<revision-id>/`; keep the current approved
copy under `outputs/`.

Use `manage_versions.py snapshot` to create an immutable local package and
`manage_versions.py restore` to create a non-destructive rollback candidate
under `outputs/restored/<revision-id>/`.

## Training Mode

For each slide provide:

- one-sentence speaking goal;
- 3-5 keyword cues;
- planned seconds;
- likely teacher/judge question;
- concise answer points;
- one claim or phrase to avoid overstating.

Rehearsal checks compare `timing_sec` with note length, detect abrupt timing
changes, missing transitions, long sentences, and vocabulary that is difficult
to say naturally.

## Quality Report

Score each slide from 0-100 for:

- logic;
- evidence;
- readability;
- speakability;
- defense readiness.

Scores summarize findings and never replace slide-specific fixes. Every issue
must include severity, target, problem, impact, and concrete fix.

## Export Matrix

Supported local deliverables:

- editable PPTX;
- PDF exported through LibreOffice;
- PNG page previews/contact sheet;
- Markdown speaker notes;
- HTML teleprompter;
- quality report;
- revision manifest.

DOCX notes are optional only when the installed `document-skills` package
exposes a compatible document workflow. Web editing, cloud synchronization, and
multi-user collaboration require an external service and are not claimed by
this local plugin.
