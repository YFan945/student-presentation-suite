# Slide Spec YAML

Slide Spec v2 adds layered content, story roles, evidence references, locking,
and revision metadata while remaining backward-compatible with v1 specs. Omit
`schema_version` for legacy input or set it to `"2.0"` for the expanded model.

Use Slide Spec YAML as an optional handoff format when:
- the user says the outline will later become a PPTX
- the deck is complex or group-based
- the user asks for structured output
- the review should compare plan vs actual slides

Do not force YAML for simple outline-only requests.

## Required Fields

Each slide entry must include:
- `id`: slide number
- `title`: claim-style title for argumentative/evidence slides; descriptive title is allowed for cover, divider, quotation, references, appendix, Q&A, and closing slides
- `layout`: intended layout or slide type
- `content`: short on-slide text or structured objects
- `timing_sec`: planned speaking time as an integer number of seconds
- `owner`: speaker/member, or `Individual`

Optional slide fields:
- `kind`: `cover`, `content`, `section-divider`, `quotation`, `references`, `appendix`, `qa`, or `closing`; defaults conceptually to `content`
- `visual`: visual type and purpose; omit when a visual would be forced or decorative
- `note_goal`: what the speaker note should accomplish
- `transition`: transition or handoff sentence; omit on the final slide or when no meaningful transition exists

Optional deck-level `meta` may carry confirmed constraints across planning, PPTX production, and review:

Meta field rules:
- Recommended required fields: `topic`, `presentation_type`, `language`,
  `duration_min`, and `format`
- Optional fields: `slide_count`, `members`, `course`, `audience`, `rubric`,
  `source_material`, `template`, `logo`, `image_source`, `visual_style`,
  `deliverables`, and `output_prefix`
- v2 control fields: `scenario`, `audience_type`, `audience_depth`,
  `structure_mode`, `interaction_mode`, `quality_level`,
  `max_words_per_slide`, `max_chinese_chars_per_slide`, `visual_text_ratio`,
  `include_speaker_notes`, `include_key_lines`, `citation_style`,
  `export_formats`, and `versioning`
- `language`: `"Chinese" | "English" | "bilingual"`
- `format`: `"individual" | "group"`
- `duration_min`: number of minutes
- `slide_count`: integer target slide count
- `image_source`: `"user-assets" | "web-search" | "generated" | "diagram-only" | "text-only" | "ask-before-web-search"`
- `source_material`: a short evidence-boundary description or a list of supplied sources
- `visual_style`: confirmed style name from the style menu or a user-defined direction
- `deliverables`: confirmed output names such as `"pptx"`, `"speaker-notes"`,
  `"preview"`, `"change-summary"`, `"full-script"`, or `"pdf"`
- Use short ASCII-safe `output_prefix` when a later PPTX output filename needs a stable slug.
- For PPTX work, populate meta from the explicitly confirmed Production Summary
  defined in `presentation-intake.md`; do not turn unconfirmed recommendations
  into a Slide Spec.

Optional top-level fields for existing deck improvement:
- `source_deck`: path or label of the original PPTX/PDF/preview being improved
- `edit_intent`: `"review-fix" | "content-rewrite" | "visual-redesign" | "template-adapt" | "rebuild-clean-copy"`
- `review_findings`: structured issues from `student-presentation-review`; each item should include `severity`, `target`, `problem`, and `fix`
- `preserve`: required elements to keep, such as template, logo, footer, citations, approved slide order, or strong existing content
- `change_summary_required`: set to `true` when the PPTX workflow must write `outputs/<topic>-change-summary.md`

Optional v2 slide fields:

- `role`: story function such as `problem`, `method`, `result`, `limitation`, or `conclusion`
- `claim`: the one message the audience should remember
- `supporting_points`: concise reasons, examples, or evidence
- `slide_copy`: final compact PPT wording
- `speaker_notes`: speakable explanation rather than an essay
- `key_line`: optional memorable sentence
- `evidence_refs`: ids from the top-level Evidence Ledger
- `locked` and `lock_reason`: prevent later optimization from changing approved content

Optional v2 top-level fields:

- `evidence_ledger`: traceable sources with confidence and slide usage
- `revision`: revision id, parent revision, and reason
- `revision_operation`, `target_slides`, and `target_section`: constrain local
  rewrite, compression, expansion, evidence addition, section rewrite, or style changes

Schema and validation:
- JSON Schema: `references/slide-spec.schema.json`
- Validator: `scripts/validate_slide_spec.py`
- The validator requires `jsonschema` and `PyYAML` from `requirements.txt`.
- Unknown fields are rejected in `meta`, slides, visuals, and review findings to catch spelling mistakes.
- Semantic validation also checks contiguous slide ids, `slide_count`, total timing vs `duration_min`, group members/owners, existing-deck combinations, high-score controls, evidence references, and lock semantics.

## Example

```yaml

  - id: 3
    title: "Convenience is the main reason students choose short videos for news"
    layout: "comparison"
    content:
      bullets:
        - "Fast updates"
        - "Low reading effort"
        - "Easy sharing"
    visual:
      type: "bar-chart"
      purpose: "Compare the top three survey reasons"
    note_goal: "Explain the survey result without reading every number"
    transition: "But convenience also creates a reliability problem."
    timing_sec: 50
    owner: "Member B"
```

## PPTX Handoff Rules

When `student-presentation-ppt` receives Slide Spec YAML:
- preserve slide order and ownership
- treat `visual.purpose` as required design intent when `visual` is present
- use integer `timing_sec` values to balance speaker notes
- keep `layout` unless a better layout is needed to prevent crowding
- implement `layout` as a functional intent, not a fixed visual template
- split slides or move details into speaker notes when content is dense; do not shrink normal body text below shared typography thresholds to make content fit
- report any spec item that cannot be implemented
- do not invent visuals or transitions for slide kinds where they would be decorative or artificial
- when `source_deck` or `review_findings` is present, treat the spec as an existing-deck improvement plan: preserve listed elements, apply the findings, write a separate improved PPTX, and create `outputs/<topic>-change-summary.md` when required

## Layout Functional Mapping

Use these mappings as intent rules. The final visual form may vary by creative direction.

- `timeline`: must show sequence, phases, or change over time. May use a horizontal timeline, vertical timeline, stepped path, roadmap, process ribbon, or milestone cards.
- `comparison`, `comparison-cards`, `before-after`: must make differences easy to scan. May use side-by-side panels, 2x2 matrix, before/after cards, annotated examples, or contrast bands.
- `process`, `three-step-process`, `loop-diagram`: must show flow, order, or feedback. May use numbered nodes, cycle diagram, path diagram, swimlane, or staged panels.
- `risk-callout`, `limitations`: must identify the risk or boundary and explain why it matters. May use warning callouts, evidence cards, redline annotations, or limitation panels.
- `data`, `chart`, `survey`: must put the conclusion near the chart/table and avoid unexplained raw data. Use one main chart/table per slide.
- `team-workflow`, `handoff`: must show member ownership and speaking flow. May use role lanes, member cards, sequence markers, or workflow arrows.
- `summary-qa`, `closing`: must leave one memorable takeaway and a clear Q&A/closing cue. May use a summary card, final claim, key-number recap, or question prompt.

## Review Rules

When `student-presentation-review` receives Slide Spec YAML plus a deck:
- compare planned title, layout, visual, timing, and owner against the actual deck
- flag missing visuals, changed claims, lost handoff lines, or timing drift
- treat mismatches as risks, not automatic errors, when the final deck improves clarity
