# Visual Style Menu

Load `../../../references/shared-standards.md` for typography, readability, and anti-AI consistency. Load `../../../references/image-strategy.md` before choosing photo, generated image, diagram, or fallback visual treatments.

Use these presets as creative directions when the user does not provide a school template or visual direction. Ask the user to choose when visual style materially matters.

Each direction defines intent and guardrails, not a fixed template. The deck may vary layout, cover treatment, section rhythm, chart style, and visual metaphors as long as readability, density, contrast, source safety, and delivery QA remain intact.

## Applying A Style File

Treat the selected style file as executable generation control, not mood-board language:

1. Map its palette roles to actual slide colors: canvas, surface, primary text, secondary text, primary accent, and optional secondary accent.
2. Follow its composition and geometry rules for margins, corner treatment, alignment, and visual weight.
3. Use its slide-type recipes to vary cover, section, content, data, comparison, process, and closing pages.
4. Follow its image and chart treatment instead of adding generic stock photos or default chart colors.
5. Respect its density and repetition limits. Do not repeat one layout more than twice in succession unless a comparison sequence requires it.
6. Run its acceptance checks after rendering. If a style-specific rule conflicts with readability, source safety, a supplied school template, or user instructions, those higher-priority constraints win.

Style files use approximate ratios rather than pixel-perfect templates. Interpret `60/40`, `2/3 + 1/3`, or similar values as composition guidance within the slide safe area.

When the user is unsure about style, show every style in the menu below. Rank the most suitable directions first and add short reasons to the top recommendations, for example: "Academic Rigorous — safest for defense and teacher-facing evaluation" or "Creative Student — better for campus life and product showcase topics." Keep the remaining styles visible in a compact list so the user can make an informed choice.

## Choosing For An Unsure User

When the user says they are unsure, gives only a topic, or asks "你来定", offer or choose styles this way:
- Defense/research/teacher-scored work: offer `Academic Rigorous`, `Data Driven`, and topic-specific `Ocean Tech` or `Charcoal Editorial`.
- Business/entrepreneurship/project pitch: offer `Midnight Business`, `Data Driven`, and `Coral Energy`.
- AI/software/engineering/system design: offer `Ocean Tech`, `Academic Rigorous`, and `Modern Minimal`.
- Sustainability/health/social good: offer `Forest Moss`, `Teal Trust`, and `Academic Rigorous`.
- Humanities/culture/education reflection: offer `Warm Terracotta`, `Charcoal Editorial`, and `Berry Cream`.
- Campus life/creative/product concept: offer `Creative Student`, `Coral Energy`, and `Modern Minimal`.
- If the grading context is unknown, include at least one conservative option and one expressive option.

When asking a Chinese user to choose, show the English style name and 中文别名, for example `Ocean Tech（海洋科技）`. List all styles, but separate 3-5 recommended choices from a compact "other available styles" list. If the user explicitly asks the agent to decide, choose one and state why instead of asking again.

## General Visual Principles

- choose a palette that feels specific to the topic instead of defaulting to blue
- use 60-70% dominant color weight, 1-2 supporting colors, and one accent
- create clear hierarchy through size, color, spacing, and section rhythm
- use a consistent visual motif across the whole deck: rounded image frames, numbered tabs, side bars, circular icons, thick edge bands, or chart callout pills
- vary layouts across slides instead of repeating the same card grid
- use dark cover/conclusion with lighter content slides when appropriate
- content slides should use a meaningful visual element when it helps explain, compare, evidence, or organize the message; covers, section dividers, quotation slides, references, appendix, and Q&A pages do not need forced decoration
- avoid decorative underline strokes when they are merely habitual; preserve them when they are part of a supplied template or a deliberate, consistent visual system

## Structural Visual Layer

Use visible structural elements when they organize information or establish hierarchy. Do not require a panel, card, divider, or diagram on every slide.

Use:
- background shape layers to divide sections
- translucent panels or frosted-glass cards behind text
- rounded or sharp rectangles as comparison cards, process nodes, and quote blocks
- thin divider lines, numbering blocks, tabs, ribbons, and section markers
- shape callouts for key findings, limitations, Q&A risks, and conclusions
- subtle shadows or blur-like glassmorphism effects only when contrast remains strong

Avoid:
- placing text directly on busy images without a readable panel
- decorative shapes that do not support hierarchy
- low-contrast glass effects
- too many floating cards on one slide
- heavy shadows or effects that make the deck look like a marketing template

PPTX limitation on glassmorphism: PowerPoint cannot reliably reproduce CSS-style `backdrop-filter` blur across all apps. Treat glassmorphism as simulated layered translucent shapes, soft shadows, and muted background overlays. If the effect reduces readability or fails in WPS/older PowerPoint, replace it with an opaque panel, section band, or clean shape card.

## Template Inheritance

If the user provides a school template:
- preserve logo, footer, school color, and required cover format
- use the template's placeholder structure when it improves consistency
- avoid fighting the template with unrelated palettes
- if placeholders are unclear, keep the school header/footer and rebuild the content area cleanly
