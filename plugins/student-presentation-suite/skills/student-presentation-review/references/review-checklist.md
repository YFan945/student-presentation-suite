# Student Presentation Review Checklist

Load `../../../references/shared-standards.md` for confirmed constraints, readability, anti-AI wording, AI-writing pattern risk, English, Chinese, and group standards. Load `../../../references/image-strategy.md` for image/source expectations.

## Severity

Critical:
- audience cannot understand the main point
- required defense/report sections are missing
- slides are unreadable due to text size, contrast, clipping, or overflow
- group presentation has clearly unfair or broken handoffs
- English presentation is too difficult to speak naturally

Major:
- argumentative or evidence-slide titles are labels when a claim would materially improve comprehension
- slides contain dense paragraphs or script-like text
- evidence, data, or examples are not interpreted
- visuals are decorative or unrelated
- notes are robotic, essay-like, or missing key transitions
- timing likely does not fit the required duration

Minor:
- inconsistent spacing or visual rhythm
- small wording polish
- weak conclusion wording
- optional pronunciation/glossary support
- minor source or citation cleanup

## Structure Review

Check:
- the deck has a clear story arc
- the opening explains why the topic matters
- each section connects to the next
- every slide has one main message
- the conclusion restates the main finding or lesson
- Q&A or thank-you ending is suitable for the presentation type

Defense decks should include:
- background
- objective or research question
- method, design, or work process
- results or implementation
- problems and fixes when relevant
- limitations or future work
- Q&A

## Slide Content Review

Check:
- argumentative and evidence-slide titles state the claim; covers, section dividers, references, appendix, and Q&A slides may use descriptive labels
- body text is short enough to present
- no normal slide has more than 4 bullets unless it is a deliberate summary/table
- detailed explanation belongs in speaker notes
- data slides include one conclusion sentence
- examples connect to the main argument

## Classroom Readability

Typography thresholds below follow `../../../references/shared-standards.md`. Keep them in sync.

Flag:
- Chinese normal body text likely below 22pt
- English normal body text likely below 20pt
- primary slide titles likely below 24pt, or secondary headers/labels are too small for projection
- low contrast
- text touching edges
- clipped or overflowing text
- crowded diagrams
- charts with unreadable axes or labels
- visually empty slides with only a vague sentence

## Visual Review

Check:
- images support the message
- images are clear enough for projection
- diagrams simplify the idea
- icons are not excessive
- background effects do not reduce readability
- real people, places, products, historical materials, and current examples use appropriate factual sources when needed
- image source and fallback choices match `../../../references/image-strategy.md`

## Anti-AI Wording

Use `../../../references/shared-standards.md` as the canonical anti-AI wording and AI-writing pattern risk standard. In reviews, quote only the specific deck wording that needs to change and provide a student-like replacement.

## AI Writing Pattern Risk Review

Flag:
- repeated sentence structures across multiple slides
- smooth but empty transitions
- broad conclusions without student-specific details
- claims that sound too complete or inflated
- lack of course, group, survey, experiment, or process details

Fix by adding:
- one concrete class/project detail
- one actual observation or data point
- one limitation or uncertainty
- one source note where evidence appears
- one phrase that reflects the student's own process

Do not claim to predict an AI detector result. Describe these as writing-pattern risks.

## English Presentation Review

Check:
- B1-B2 level vocabulary and grammar for general undergraduate classroom presentations by default, adjusted for course level, discipline, audience, and speaker ability
- 2-4 short sentences or phrase groups per slide
- notes use natural connectors
- long sentences are split
- difficult terms have optional pronunciation or glossary help
- speaker can say the notes aloud without sounding like an essay

## Group Presentation Review

Check:
- each member has meaningful content
- speaking time is balanced
- technical difficulty is distributed
- handoff sentences are clear
- terminology and style are consistent across members
- opening and closing are not used as filler roles

## Five-Dimension Score

When useful, rate each dimension as Excellent / Good / Needs Work / Risk:
- Logic structure: story arc, claim clarity, evidence chain
- Visual design: readability, layout, consistency, image usefulness
- Speaker notes: naturalness, timing, transitions, confidence
- Defense readiness: Q&A, limitations, source awareness, rubric fit
- Originality/student feel: concrete details, non-generic wording, personal or group process

Include one sentence explaining the score for each dimension. Do not let scoring replace concrete fixes.

## Positive Feedback

Include strong parts worth keeping when the deck has them; omit this section when no defensible positive evidence is available:
- clear topic angle
- strong data/example
- readable slide
- good visual explanation
- natural handoff
- honest limitation
- memorable conclusion

## Rubric-Aligned Review

If the user provides a rubric:
- organize feedback under the rubric dimensions
- estimate likely strengths and weak spots
- do not invent exact scores unless the rubric supports them
- map quick fixes to the highest-weight criteria first

## Slide Spec Vs Actual

When a Slide Spec YAML is provided with a deck:
- compare planned title, layout, content, visual purpose, timing, and owner with the actual slide
- flag lost design intent, missing visuals, changed claims, or timing drift
- treat differences as risks unless the actual slide is clearly better

## Before/After Diff Review

When two versions are provided:
- list fixed issues
- list unresolved issues
- list new issues introduced by the revision
- identify whether the newer version is clearly better, slightly better, mixed, or worse
- give the next 3 highest-priority fixes

## PPTX XML Static Check

For `.pptx` files, run `python skills/student-presentation-review/scripts/pptx_static_check.py` from the plugin package root when available to scan static XML risks:
- font size below threshold
- high text density
- small text boxes
- paragraph-heavy text
- excessive color complexity

Use `--strict` only for automated validation where a failed scan should fail the step. Treat script output as risk evidence, not absolute proof. `font-size-not-explicit` often means the script could not resolve inherited theme or master styles, not that the deck is definitely unreadable. True overflow and projection readability still need rendered previews or manual inspection.

## Suggested Output

For each issue, include:
- severity
- slide/page number when known
- problem
- why it matters
- concrete fix

Example:

```markdown
- Major, Slide 4: The title "Analysis" does not tell the audience the conclusion.
  Fix: Rename it to "Convenience is the main reason students choose short videos for news".
```
